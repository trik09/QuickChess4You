## Features & Functionality Questions

### Q4: What pages are included in the prototype?
**A:** Three main pages:
1. **Login Page (/)** - User authentication interface
2. **Dashboard (/dashboard)** - Tournament listings with cards
3. **Puzzle Page (/puzzle)** - Interactive chess puzzle solver

### Q5: Does the login actually authenticate users?
**A:** No, the login is currently a UI prototype. Clicking "Log in" navigates directly to the dashboard. For production, you'll need to integrate with a backend authentication system (JWT, OAuth, etc.).

### Q6: How many puzzles are available?
**A:** 10 chess puzzles with varying difficulty:
- Puzzles 1-4: Mate in 1 (Beginner)
- Puzzles 5-8: Mate in 2 (Intermediate)
- Puzzles 9-10: Mate in 3 (Advanced)

### Q7: Are the puzzles real and solvable?
**A:** Yes! All puzzles use verified chess positions with correct solutions. The chess.js library validates all moves according to official chess rules.

### Q8: How does the puzzle validation work?
**A:** 
- When you make a move, it's compared against the expected solution
- **Correct move:** Green "✓ Correct!" message appears, you continue
- **Wrong move:** Red "✗ Wrong Move!" appears, board resets after 1.5 seconds
- **Puzzle solved:** Orange "🎉 Puzzle Solved!" message when complete

### Q9: Can users actually move the chess pieces?
**A:** Yes! The board is fully interactive:
- Click a piece to select it
- Valid moves are highlighted with dots
- Click destination square to move
- Only legal chess moves are allowed
- Last move is highlighted in green

### Q10: Does the timer actually count down?
**A:** Yes! The timer starts at 4:59 and counts down every second. It resets when you switch to a different puzzle.

### Q12: How do users switch between puzzles?
**A:** Three ways:
1. Click puzzle numbers (1-10) in the right panel
2. Use Previous (◀) arrow button
3. Use Next (▶) arrow button

### Q13: What information is shown for tournaments?
**A:** Each tournament card displays:
- Tournament name
- Date range
- Number of participants
- Prize pool
- Status badge (Open/Closed)
- "Participate" button

### Q14: Is the tournament data real?
**A:** No, it's static demo data (4 tournaments). For production, this should be fetched from a backend API.

## Data & Backend Questions

### Q20: Where is the puzzle data stored?
**A:** Currently hardcoded in `PuzzlePage.jsx` as a JavaScript array. Each puzzle object contains:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `type`: Difficulty description (e.g., "Mate in 2")
- `fen`: Chess position in FEN notation
- `solution`: Array of moves in algebraic notation
- `description`: Puzzle description text

### Q21: What backend integration is needed for production?
**A:** You'll need APIs for:
1. **Authentication:** Login, register, logout, session management
2. **User Profile:** Store user progress, ratings, solved puzzles
3. **Puzzles:** Fetch puzzles from database, track completion
4. **Tournaments:** CRUD operations, registration, scheduling
5. **Leaderboards:** Rankings, statistics, achievements

### Q22: What database schema would you recommend?
**A:** Suggested tables:
- **users:** id, email, password_hash, username, rating, created_at
- **puzzles:** id, fen, solution, difficulty, type, rating
- **user_puzzles:** user_id, puzzle_id, solved, attempts, time_taken
- **tournaments:** id, name, start_date, end_date, prize, max_participants
- **tournament_registrations:** tournament_id, user_id, registered_at

### Q23: What's the FEN notation used in puzzles?
**A:** FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) is a standard notation for describing chess positions. Example:
```
'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 1'
```
- Piece positions (lowercase = black, uppercase = white)
- Active color (w/b)
- Castling rights (KQkq)
- En passant square
- Halfmove clock
- Fullmove number
